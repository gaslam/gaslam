# About me
Hello there ðŸ‘‹


I'm @gaslam, student at Howest University Of Applied Maths and Sciences in Belgium.

I did finish my studies for the programme: Associate Degree Computer Programming at Howest Bruges. Now I'm currently doing the bachelor: DAE Game Development course at Howest Kortrijk.

So far, I have experience in the following languages:

- C# (.NET, .NET Web Api/Web App, Xamarin)
- HTML
- CSS (not advanced, but still good)
- Vanilla JS
- C++

As for the rest there are some technologies that I had a bit of experience with, like for example:

- Docker
- Flutter
- Firebase
- SQL
- MongoDB

I would also like to learn:
- Unreal Engine 5
- Unity
- Working with graphic API's like Vulkan and DirectX
- The rest of mathmetics I still need to know to work with those API's
- Looking at the possibilities of combining technologies I learned with
  the experience gained from my course in programming
